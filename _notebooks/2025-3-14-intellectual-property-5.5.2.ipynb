    "\n",
    " - **Educational use** *(teaching, research, or scholarship)*\n",
    " - **Commentary and criticism** *(news reporting, reviews)*\n",
    " - **Parody** *(transformative works that mock the original)*\n",
    " - **Limited reproduction for personal or nonprofit purposes**\n",
    " - **Fair use is determined by factors such as the purpose of use, the nature of the work, the amount used, and its impact on the market value.**\n",

    "**Copyright expires** *(e.g., many classic books and music pieces)*\n",

Without proper protection, individuals and businesses may face financial losses and a lack of recognition for their contributions.\n",
